# Contributing to the HacktoberFest Virtual Hackathon

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the HacktoberFest Virtual Hackathon hosted by Mohan Babu University. To ensure a smooth and collaborative experience, please follow these guidelines when participating in the hackathon:

## Getting Started

1. Choose a GitHub project from the GDSC MBU team's repositories that aligns with your skill set and interests. Browse through the open issues to find a task you'd like to work on.

2. Before starting your work, make sure you have a GitHub account. If you don't have one, you can create it at [GitHub Sign Up](https://github.com/join).

3. Fork the repository of the chosen project to your GitHub account.

4. Clone your forked repository to your local development environment.

5. Create a new branch for your contribution, naming it descriptively (e.g., `fix-issue-123` or `feature/new-feature-name`).

## Making a Contribution

1. Before you start working on the issue, create a formal request to the issue creator for assignment in the following format:

    ```
    Name: [Your Name]
    Roll No: [Your Roll No]
    Year:
    Branch:
    Section:
    ```

2. Once the issue creator assigns the issue to you, work on your contribution. Make sure your changes align with the guidelines and coding standards of the project.

3. Write clean and concise code, add relevant comments, and ensure proper documentation if necessary.

4. After completing your contribution, commit your changes, push them to your forked repository, and create a pull request.

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Ensure your pull request title and description clearly describe the issue you're addressing and the changes you've made.

2. Reference the issue number in your pull request description using the "Fixes #123" format to automatically link it to the issue.

3. Submit the pull request.

## Review and Valid Contribution

1. Your contribution will be reviewed by the project maintainers and the GDSC MBU team.

2. If your contribution meets the project's guidelines and standards, it will be merged into the main project.

3. Once your contribution is added to the main project, it should not be changed for at least seven days to be considered a valid contribution for the Hackathon.

Thank you for participating in the HacktoberFest Virtual Hackathon at Mohan Babu University. Happy hacking!
