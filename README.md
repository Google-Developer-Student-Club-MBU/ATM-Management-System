# ATM-Management-System
Welcome to the ATM Management System project in Java. This project is a console-based simulation of an Automated Teller Machine (ATM) system, offering a user-friendly interface for customers to access and manage their bank accounts securely.

#Introduction
          In today's fast-paced world, ATMs have become an integral part of our daily lives, providing convenient access to banking services 24/7. The ATM Management System project aims to replicate the core functionalities of a real-world ATM, facilitating transactions such as withdrawals, deposits, balance inquiries, PIN changes, and transaction history tracking.
          This project serves as an educational tool for aspiring Java developers to gain hands-on experience in building interactive and robust software systems. By diving into this project, you'll have the opportunity to explore key Java programming concepts, including object-oriented design, user input handling, data management, and error handling.

# Features
User Authentication: The ATM Management System ensures the security of customers' accounts through robust user authentication, requiring a valid account number and a four-digit Personal Identification Number (PIN).

# Account Management: 
Customers can conveniently perform various account management tasks, including:
# Account Balance Inquiry: 
Check the current balance of their accounts.
# Cash Withdrawals: 
Withdraw money from their accounts, ensuring that withdrawals do not exceed available balances.
# Cash Deposits: 
Deposit funds into their accounts, instantly updating the account balance.
# Transaction History: 
The system keeps a meticulous record of all customer transactions, allowing them to review their financial history with ease. Transaction details include the date, time, type of transaction, and the transaction amount.
# PIN Change: 
For enhanced security, customers can change their PINs regularly to safeguard their accounts against unauthorized access.
# Error Handling: 
Robust error handling mechanisms are in place to gracefully manage scenarios such as insufficient funds, incorrect PINs, and system errors. This ensures a smooth and user-friendly experience.
